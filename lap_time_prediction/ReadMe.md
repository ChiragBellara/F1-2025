# GOAL
Build a Machine Learning model to predict the lap times of an F1 car based on given telemetry, tire, and environmental data

# FACTORS affecting lap times
1. Track Characteristics
    - Circuit Layout
    - Surface Temperature
    - Altitude  -> HOW?
    - Weather Conditions -> wind, rainfall, temperature, 

2. Car Performance
    - Aerodynamics
    - Tires
